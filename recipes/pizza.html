      <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
      <div class="container">
        <ul>
          <li>4 1/2 cups unbleached bread flour, chilled</li>
          <li>1 3/4 teaspoons salt</li>
          <li>1 teaspoon instant yeast</li>
          <li>1/4 cup olive oil</li>
          <li>1 3/4 cups water, ice cold</li>
          <li>Semolina flour or cornmeal for dusting</li>
        </ul>

      <h2>Steps:</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Step 1: Combine all the ingredients. Mix by hand or with a stand mixer
          fitted with the dough hook. Knead for 5-7 minutes, or as long as it
          takes to create a smooth, sticky dough. The dough should clear the
          sides of the bowl, but stick to the bottom of the bowl. If the dough
          is too wet and doesn't come off the sides of the bowl, sprinkle in
          some more flour until it clears the sides. If it clears the bottom of
          the bowl, dribble in a teaspoon or two of cold water. The finished
          dough with be springy, elastic, and sticky, not just tacky.

          Step 2: Cover a baking sheet with parchment paper and mist it with
          cooking spray. Divide the dough into four to six equal parts. Using a
          little flour if the dough is very sticky, gently shape each piece into
          a ball and place on the baking sheet. Mist the dough with oil or
          cooking spray and then cover with plastic wrap. Place in the fridge
          for at least one day or up to three days.
        </li>
        <li>
          Step 3: Remove the dough 2 hours before you plan on baking. Before
          letting the dough rest at room temperature, dust the counter with
          flour, and then mist the counter with spray oil. Place the dough ball
          on top of the floured counter and sprinkle them with flour. Gently
          press the dough into flat disks about 1/2 inch thick. Sprinkle the
          dough with flour, mist it again with spray oil, and cover the dough
          loosely with plastic wrap. Now let rest for two hours.
        </li>
        <li>
          Step 4: At least 45 minutes before baking the pizza, place a baking
          stone on a rack in the lower third of the oven. Heat the oven as hot
          as possible (500-550 degrees in most ovens). If you do not have a
          baking stone, you can use the back of a sheet pan, but do not preheat
          the pan.

          Step 5: With your hand or a rolling pin, shape one of the portioned
          dough pieces to the desired size and thickness. Place on a cornmeal
          dusted pizza peel or the back of a baking sheet. Top with desired
          toppings (less is more) and slide the pizza onto the baking stone (or
          bake directly on the sheet pan) and close the door. Bake until crust
          is lightly golden and cheese is melted and bubbly.
