    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <div>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Beef: These basic burgers start with 1 ½ pounds of lean ground beef.
        </li>
        <li>Onion: A finely chopped onion takes the flavor up a notch.</li>
        <li>Cheese: You’ll need shredded Colby Jack or Cheddar cheese.</li>
        <li>Egg: An egg lends moisture and helps bind the patties together.</li>
        <li>
          Seasonings, herbs, and sauces: These hamburgers are flavored with an
          envelope of dry onion soup mix, fresh garlic, garlic powder, soy
          sauce, Worcestershire sauce, dried parsley, dried basil, dried
          oregano, crushed dried rosemary, salt, and pepper.
        </li>
      </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <div>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat and lightly oil the grate.
        </li>
        <li>
          Meanwhile, combine ground beef, onion, cheese, egg, onion soup mix,
          minced garlic, garlic powder, soy sauce, Worcestershire sauce,
          parsley, basil, oregano, rosemary, salt, and pepper in a large bowl.
          Use your hands to form the mixture into 4 patties.
        </li>
        <li>
          Cook patties on the preheated grill until no longer pink in the center
          and the juices run clear, about 4 to 5 minutes per side. An
          instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least
          165 degrees F (74 degrees C).
        </li>
      </ol>
